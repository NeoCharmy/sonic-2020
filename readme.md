This is the OFFICIAL 3D HTML5 demo/mini game of sonic at the olympic games (2020) which I've revived for web browsers

[PLAY NOW](https://neocharmy.github.io/sonic-2020/)

 [(first rule of sonic games: the more you hold jump, the higher you go up)]

## where was it before?
only on crazygames.com
& they removed it, just as silent as they'd release it.
only this [news page](https://developer.crazygames.com/blog/play-sonic-at-the-olympic-game)
 was left on this site

## how did I get its files?
from [flash point](https://flashpointarchive.org/downloads) of course, the only available source

## was it free? 

sure the demo was 

## what even was the original game?

it was a mobile game back in 2020 with only sonic characters, along with the switch game, mario & sonic at the olympic games tokyo 2020 & they also removed this from everywhere a while back

## why did I do this?

so no one will have to download 1GB for flash point to play this, & of course, it's playable on any device since it's a web game, & also it's becoming a lost media now man, I couldn't find a single video about this on youtube

## how to get full version now?
google it. 
 
RIP sonic & mario olympic series...or...mario & sonic
whatever

this is just a little revived project by a fan, for fans
